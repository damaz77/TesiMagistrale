In this work we have presented many different approaches to model the Portfolio Selection problem. In particular, we chose to focus the most on a risk based diversification strategy named Risk Parity. There are many formulations for Risk Parity problem, both convex or non-convex.\\ After a quick overview on the pre-existents solving algorithms for this kind of problem, we proposed a globally convergent decomposition framework that aims to solve a non-convex formulation.\\ Our framework performs decomposition at two levels: a two-block Gauss-Seidel decomposition with respect to the $x$ and $y$ variables and then a further decomposition with respect to $x$. We proposed two slightly different versions of the decomposition algorithm that use a different approach to perform the decomposition with respect to $x$: the first uses Quadratic Line Search while the second uses an Exact Line Search on a proximal point modification of the problem.\\ We were able to proof the convergence properties of both the proposed methods and then we have compared them against a standard solver (SNOPT) in terms of computational times and quality of the Risk Parity solution produced using different settings.
