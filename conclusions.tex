In this work we have presented many different approaches to model the Portfolio Selection problem. In particular, we choose to focus the most on a risk based diversification strategy named Risk Parity. There are many formulations for Risk Parity problem, both convex or non-convex. After a quick overview on the pre-existents solving algorithms for this kind of problem, we proposed a globally convergent decomposition framework that aims to solve a non-convex formulation. We were able to proof the convergence properties of the proposed method and then we have compared it against a standard solver (SNOPT) in terms of computational times and quality of the Risk Parity solution produced using different settings.
